To use the trained model access and compile an example using either a microphone or continuous microphone. When it is running speak into the microphone and it will attempt to classify what is being said. Use the serial monitor to find out the results. They keywords it can detect are - 'Light On', 'Light Off', 'Livingroom On', 'Livingroom Off', 'Bedroom On', 'Bedroom Off', 'Kitchen On', 'Kitchen Off'. The solution is not perfect and will occasionaly mistake words for others such as mistaking 'Livingroom On' for 'Bedroom On'.
